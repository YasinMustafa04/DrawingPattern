# Java Pattern Drawing Project

Welcome to the **Java Pattern Drawing Project!** 🎉

This project showcases various pattern drawing implementations using Java. I created it to demonstrate the use of:
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- User input handling

## 📝 Project Overview

This Java program draws different patterns in the console based on user selection. The user can choose a pattern, provide the required dimensions, and the program will generate the specified pattern accordingly.

## 📂 Patterns to Implement

The project includes the following pattern types:

### 1️⃣ Right-angled Triangle
```
